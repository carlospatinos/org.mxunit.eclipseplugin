<h1>Getting Started: Configuring Global Preferences</h1>

<h2>The preferences</h2>
<p>
There are 2 global preferences:

	<ul>
		<li>Remote Facade URL</li>
		<li>Your web root</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>
This plugin works by making soap (i.e. webservice) calls to a URL. By default, that URL is to a RemoteFacade.cfc that 
comes bundled with the MXUnit framework. When you first installed the plugin, it made a reasonable attempt at 
guessing the location of this Remote URL, but more than likely it guessed wrong... so you'll need to set it up correctly. 
</p>

<p>In addition, in order for the plugin to correctly determine the CFC notation for your components, you'll need to 
specify the location of your web root. The thinking here is that more often than not, test components will live under
the webroot. So a one-time setup of the webroot is all most people will need. Subsequently, any tests under the webroot
will have their CFC notation correctly determined. (However, for those who have projects with tests outside the webroot, there's 
a bit of additional project-level configuration you'll need to do. See below.)
</p>

<h2>How</h2>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Window -- Preferences -- MXUnit</li>
	<li>Check and correct the URL if necessary. For example, maybe it currently reads "http://localhost/mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc" 
	but your CF installation is at localhost:8501. Change the URL accordingly.
	<li>Check and correct your webroot if necessary. For example, maybe your webroot is c:\cfusionmx\wwwroot instead of c:\inetpub\wwwroot.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Overriding these preferences for special cases</h2>
<p>
There are times when these preferences won't suit your needs:
<ul>
	<li>You need custom remote functionality. For example, you need the RemoteFacade.cfc to include a custom Application.cfm file for every test</li>
	<li>Your test components are not underneath your webroot but are instead accessed by means of a CF mapping</li>
</ul>
In these cases, you'll need to <a href="configureProjectProperties.html">override certain properties at the project level</a>.
